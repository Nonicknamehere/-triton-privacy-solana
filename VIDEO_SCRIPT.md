# 🎥 Triton Privacy - Video Script

**Duration:** 2 minutes  
**Target:** Solana Privacy Hack 2026 Judges

---

## [0:00-0:20] HOOK - The Problem

**Visual:** Dark screen with text overlays, dramatic music

**Narration:**
> "Institutions control $35 TRILLION in assets. But they can't use Solana DeFi. Why?"

**Visual:** Three problems appear on screen with X marks

**Narration:**
> "One: No compliance infrastructure. No KYC, no AML, no sanctions screening.  
> Two: MEV bots front-run every single trade.  
> Three: Public addresses reveal their entire strategy.  
> 
> Until now."

## [0:20-0:50] DEMO - The Solution

**Visual:** Screen recording of Triton Privacy app

**Narration:**
> "This is Triton Privacy. Watch how it works."

**Visual:** Connect wallet button clicked

**Narration:**
> "I connect my wallet. First, Range API checks compliance."

**Visual:** Compliance check animation, green checkmark appears

**Narration:**
> "Passed. No sanctions, low risk score. Now I swap 0.5 SOL to USDC."

**Visual:** Swap form filled out, execute button clicked

**Narration:**
> "Here's the magic: This swap executes in MagicBlock's TEE - a secure enclave. MEV bots can't see it. Front-runners can't touch it. It's completely private."

**Visual:** Logs showing TEE execution, then finalization

**Narration:**
> "The result commits back to Solana L1. Jupiter gave us the best price, but the execution was invisible."

## [0:50-1:20] TECH - How It Works

**Visual:** Architecture diagram animating

**Narration:**
> "Four layers make this possible."

**Visual:** Layer 1 highlights

**Narration:**
> "Layer one: Range API screens every wallet. Sanctions lists, risk scoring, mixer exposure. Institutions need this."

**Visual:** Layer 2 highlights

**Narration:**
> "Layer two: MagicBlock's TEE. Your swap delegates to a secure enclave. Execution is private. No mempool visibility."

**Visual:** Layer 3 highlights

**Narration:**
> "Layer three: Jupiter V6 routes through shared liquidity. Best execution, every time."

**Visual:** Layer 4 highlights

**Narration:**
> "Layer four: Helius RPC delivers transactions reliably. Production-grade infrastructure."

**Visual:** Full architecture glowing

**Narration:**
> "This is TPS with privacy. Solana's speed, institutional compliance."

## [1:20-1:45] IMPACT - What This Unlocks

**Visual:** Use cases appearing on screen

**Narration:**
> "What does this unlock?"

**Visual:** Dark pool trading interface

**Narration:**
> "Dark pools for institutions. Trade without revealing your strategy."

**Visual:** DeFi protocols

**Narration:**
> "Private DeFi without mixers. No regulatory gray area."

**Visual:** Global map with connections

**Narration:**
> "Compliant privacy at scale. The bridge between TradFi and DeFi."

## [1:45-2:00] CLOSE - Call to Action

**Visual:** Triton Privacy logo, sponsor logos

**Narration:**
> "Triton Privacy. Built with MagicBlock, Range, Jupiter, and Helius."

**Visual:** URLs appear

**Narration:**
> "Live demo at triton-privacy.vercel.app. Code on GitHub. This is how institutions come to Solana."

**Visual:** Fade to black with tagline

> Institutional DeFi. Compliant. Private. Fast.  
> Built for Solana Privacy Hack 2026"
