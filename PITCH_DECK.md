🔱 TRITON PRIVACY

Institutional DeFi with Compliance & Privacy

Built for Solana Privacy Hack 2026
```

## Slide 2: The Problem

**Visual:** Three columns with X marks

```
$35 TRILLION LOCKED OUT OF SOLANA DEFI

❌ No Compliance          ❌ MEV Extraction        ❌ Public Addresses
   No KYC/AML                Front-running            Strategy revealed
   No sanctions screening    Value leaked             No privacy
   Regulatory risk           Unfair execution         Competitive disadvantage
```

**Key Stat:** "Only 0.01% of institutional capital is in DeFi"

---

## Slide 3: The Solution

**Visual:** Four-layer architecture diagram

```
TRITON PRIVACY: 4-LAYER ARCHITECTURE

Layer 1: COMPLIANCE (Range API)
└─ Sanctions screening, risk scoring, KYC/AML

Layer 2: PRIVACY (MagicBlock TEE)
└─ Private execution in secure enclave

Layer 3: EXECUTION (Jupiter V6)
└─ Best price routing through shared liquidity

Layer 4: INFRASTRUCTURE (Helius RPC)
└─ Production-grade transaction delivery
```

---

## Slide 4: How It Works

**Visual:** User flow diagram with screenshots

```
USER FLOW

1. Connect Wallet
   └─ Phantom, Solflare, etc.

2. Compliance Check (Range)
   └─ Sanctions ✓ Risk Score ✓ Exposure ✓

3. Configure Swap
   └─ Amount, token, slippage

4. Private Execution (MagicBlock TEE)
   └─ Invisible to MEV bots

5. Commit to L1 (Jupiter)
   └─ Best execution, public result
```
